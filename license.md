# Locria's No Bullshit License v1.0

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
The phrase "have to" means "MUST".

This license is provided to you under [CC-BY-4.0](https://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/CC-BY-4.0). If you want to modify this license to suit your own use case, then you must not use the same license name. You can, however, call your modified license something like "Joe's No Bullshit License". Then, you can use whatever copyright protection for your new license.

## ยง0. Introduction

You want to use this software? If you fit any criterion in ยง1, you must not. Otherwise, you have my permission. However, the permission is revokable at any time (when I add new criteria to ยง1).

You want to modify this software? You can, but you must provide the modified source code upon request from anyone in the world. You should at least host the modified source code on IPFS or HTTP and put the link on your website, so people don't spam your mailbox for the source code.

Even if you don't provide the software directly (e.g. through a HTTP service), you still have to provide the source code (same as in [AGPL v3](https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-only.html)). Even if only a few people know you use a modified version of this software, you still need to make the modified source code available.

## ยง1. People that must not use this software

<!-- To be honest, I don't think most people in this criteria care about copy-right anyway. -->

People who are hired by, affiliated with, or sponsored by any of...

- Any organization that have monopoly on violence in a region. This includes most democratic governments' executive department/branch (which uses violence to enforce rules), and most authoritation governments.
- Amazon (the deliver service that treats warehouse workers like replaceable machine parts; the web service provider that stole open-source software's name and work)
- VISA (the credit card company that doesn't allow you to pay for sex work with your own money) and Mastercard (same reason)
- Social media companies that don't connect with each other, like Facebook (oh, it's called xxxxverse now), Twitter. YouTube's respective company don't count for now.
