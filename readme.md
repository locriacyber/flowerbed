# Graphical programming environment with effect handlers

Q: Why another graphical IDE?
A: This IDE is designed to be the tool that can handle most of your program-editing needs. What it is to writing code is what Microsoft Word is to typesetting. To be fair, I don't know a general purpose code editing tool after Visual Basic.

Q: I only use my computer to watch YouTube. Can I code with this tool?
A: No, you still have to learn type theory and math.
